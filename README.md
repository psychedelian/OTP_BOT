**I didnt generate the requirements.txt, will add it soon. Shouldnt be hard to figure out what they are for now.***

This is an OTP Bot I have made that doesnt require discord or telegram to operate, it runs entirely within terminal or 

through command prompts in windows and could easily be compiled into an exe. It is fully functional but has alot of room 

for other features and improvements. If you add anything to it keep me updated would love to see it. This bot is very customizable, even someone with no knowledge of

python should be able to alter this to fit their needs. Instructions on how to operate the bot are given below.

1.	Set your configuration in the config.txt file

2.	Open 3 command prompts. change directory of 2 of them to same directory as OTP bot, open another cmd prompt where 	your ngrok is located and start ngrok as http on 

port 5000, 'ngrok http 5000'

3.	Type 'python voice.otp' to load the voice elements in one of the other cmd prompts, and 'python bot.py' to load the 	bot in the remaining cmd prompt.

4. 	Complete neccesary information in bot to set your call information. Type phone number, and hit enter. 

Call status will update and if otp / pin given it will be displaayed at the bottom.

Each time you change any information you must restart the voice.py file for the new changes to be reflected in the call. 

So remember to restart voice.py every t‚ÅÆime you change something
